## FAQ

  Is JingOS going to be opensource? And free software?

  > Yes, JingOS has been opensourced on Github. And JingOS will be free forever.

  What is JingOS based on?

  > JingOS is based on Ubuntu 20.04, KDE v5.75, Plasma Mobile 5.20. We will replace the framework from Plasma Mobile to JDE (Jing Desktop Environment) later this year.


  If JingOS is a tablet OS, does it require apps to respect the life cycle, like what happens when suspended? How does it manage permission? Is there a permission system like iOS? Are the apps sandboxed? If it can just run Linux apps, how would they respect life cycle, permission, and stuff? Will you use snap/flatpak for the permissions system?

  > Life-cycle management API will come with JingOS v0.8 in March, apps designed for JingOS can be suspended like any other tablet OSs. The permission system and app sandbox are still in discussion, not decided yet.

  Compared to other Linux distros, is JingOS optimized for tablet only in the UI / specialized apps, or are there performance tweaks/features as well. Is it basically like a gnome / KDE but with a tablet first focussed, or are there any “lower-level” differences? What kind of lower-level differences? Drivers? Performance enhancements? What will it help Linux do on tablets especially?

  > JingOS v0.6 is mostly optimized only in the UI and specialized apps. But JingOS v0.8 would have lots of lower differences, like performance enhancements.

  Do apps have to be created for JingOS to work well? Could I use Spotify or Discord apps on it, or would there need to be JingOS versions first? JingOS just run normal Linux apps, right? So we should be able to build and run Flutter desktop apps on it? Will JingOS support android apps? To fill the gap with missing popular apps.

  > Linux apps (.deb, etc.) can run in JingOS well. You can run Android apps in the JingOS ARM version after v1.0 in June.
